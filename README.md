# LabyrinthPathFinder

This is a small exercise from a colleague, which he once had to complete as a hiring task. The task is as follows. You have a labyrinth where "#" represents a wall and you have to find a way out of the labyrinth. In the original task this was always from bottom left to top right. 

I adapted the task a bit, so that you can now specify any starting point and any end point and the algorithm checks if there is a way to get there. If it does, it will display it on the console, if it does not, it will display a corresponding message.

The path must always be specified with \\ instead of simple \, since this is used directly.
